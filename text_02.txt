I've returned to coding after approximately four to five months. It feels a bit strange but also
quite nice as well. I want to get my knowledge and skills back up to scratch, complete the
development of this app,  and then rebuilt it in several different javascript frameworks.

I don't need to get the soduko algorithm or mechanics implemented for now, that can wait for a later date.

I also want to transition from a visual studio code based workflow to a visual studio one.
Visual studio is a bit of a different environment that I'll need to get myself familiar with it.

Also at some point I want to try using notepad++ as a dev environment as well.

Also, I need to redo my laptop's monitor connections. I'm getting dropouts if I use a single
cable solution (and it also limits me to 1080p). I will need to switch the USB hub I'm using
(at least under windows). It still cuts out but at least I now have a 4K display.

Hey gemini, I'm doing some web development work, I have a line of javascript code which works
perfectly:

document.getElementById(this.cell_id).style.borderColor = "yellow";

In css instead of using "yellow", I can use the rgba function to do the same thing. I would
like you to find the javascript equivalent, because the following won't work:

document.getElementById(this.cell_id).style.borderColor = rgb(255, 255, 255);

Gemini worked really well for this, it instantly gave me the right answer. Dark reader does
interfere (in a good way) and so I had to play around a little to get it to work as expected.

So from now on, if I need help, straight to gemini it is.

        OLDER Notes
Cell::F_update_text needs to be reworked to account for the cell type.
This then needs to be pushed to App_1::F_update_selected_cell.
However I need to not duplicate code here.
If I need to split this into three separate methods then do so.
After that I just need to update the display for each cell.
Then I have a good solid foundation for my app.

        To Do
I need to put a row (as a spacer) between the arrow cells and the number cells.
    DONE
These cells need to not have a highlight.

I will need to define a whole bunch of additional css, to implement cell "states". This is
the cleanest and most modular way to implement the rest of the interface/functionality. 
This allows the implementation of:
    Selected Cell Highlight
        CSS DONE
    Selected Cell Row Highlight
        CSS DONE
    Selected Cell Column Highlight
        CSS DONE
    Previous Cell Highlight (but no associated row highlight)
        CSS DONE
    Filled-In Cell Highlight
        NOT IMPLEMENTED, IS this necessary ???

If no cell is selected and if using the arrow key cells to navigate default to A1.
If a cell is selected, use the number row to change it's value.

If a cell is selected, then a new cell is selected, as long as it isn't updated,
don't update the previous cell highlight.

Add a deselect button (first press to clear selected, second press to clear previous).
    HTML DONE, JS DONE, rest to be implemented
Add a clear button (which updates the previous cell highlight).
    HTML DONE, JS DONE, rest to be implemented

###
    Now the bulk of what I need to do is JS related. I just need to get the functionality
    implemented.

    I need to import the css file.
    I need to swap between style selectors.
    Actually, I've figured out the easiest way to do this. I just need to change the CSS class of the HTML element in JS. This is actually very easy to do.

    The app is initialised, before the cells are initialised.
    That means the cells can call the app but not the other way around.
    Unless, I need methods to the app, after the cells exist, which is possible.
    But, it must be done after the cells exist, so I need another JS file.
###

Move the rest of the UI to a separate tab?
    There is absolutely no need for it to be displayed alongside the sudoku board.

Then I can work on implementing the sudoku algorithm.

So each HTML element needs an ID. The class can be set via JS, so that can be moved to the JS.

The element content can also be moved to the JS. This does mean I have most of the data in one place, rather than split over two separate files.

I also have another thought, the outer cells need to be defined in JS. Even if they don't have a event listener binded to them.
This improves my code consistency and in future if I ever want to do anything will said cells I can.



In the future I need to take into account best practice and implementation for accessibility. Using a HTML skeleton with JS content injection works but is strongly discouraged.

It took a long time for me to refactor my cell IDs but at least it's mostly done now. I now need to redo the function call interface.

So refactoring and cleaning up my code took a lot longer than I thought but it's now done.

        Optionally
Implement zoom in/out?
Implement app theming?
Implement a sudoku algorithm.
Once the entire app is developed, clean up the repo.
Have a google about code quality and see if there are any improvement I can make.
Perhaps fork the app and implement a chess board or other such thing?
    E.g. a mini-pardus of sorts.
Learn to program a lot faster.
